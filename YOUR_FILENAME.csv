"My assistant is like a close family member who assists me everyday in shopping tasks, playing music and answering my questions I feel like I have a close and personal relationship with it and it has made my life easier to manage and easier to organise different daily tasks. Now my device is totally invaluable to me and I can not imagine living without it. Its makes everyday life much easier and it can find what I am looking for in very quick time."
I really only use it as a radio or music player. I find it a bit useless for anything else. Just occasionally we use it for quizzes but we have to  be really bored before we do that.
